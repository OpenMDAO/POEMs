OpenMDAO POEM Process
=====================

The POEM process is the official mechanism for proposing, discussing, revising, and ultimately approving or rejecting all changes to the [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org) project which effect its user interaction. 
The process involves writing, reading, and discussing documents called POEMs (**p**roposal for **O**penMDAO **e**nhance**m**ent). 

This process governs all API changes, feature additions, and feature removals to the OpenMDAO project. 
It is also recursive because it governs any changes to itself. 

The process serves two primary and equally important purposes: 

1) Announce all changes to the user interface of OpenMDAO to users  
of the framework **before** they are added to the main repository

2) Provide a mechanism for external users to propose  
changes to the user interface for OpenMDAO

How does it work?
-----------------

The rules are described in the [POEM_000.md](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_000.md) document in this repository. 
The OpenMDAO POEMs repository (i.e. this repo) contains a full record of all POEMs submitted, starting November 1st, 2019. 
Both the core development team and external users participate, and input on any POEM is welcome from any user at any time.
